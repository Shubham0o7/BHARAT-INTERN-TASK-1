# Stock Prediction using LSTM

## Project Overview:

This project explores the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for predicting stock prices. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network particularly well-suited for time series data, such as stock prices, due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.

## Project Features:

* **Data Preprocessing:** 
    * Data cleaning and handling missing values.
    * Feature engineering (e.g., technical indicators, moving averages).
    * Data normalization/standardization.
    * Data splitting into training and testing sets.
* **LSTM Model:**
    * Build and train an LSTM model with appropriate hyperparameters.
    * Implement techniques like dropout and early stopping to prevent overfitting.
* **Model Evaluation:**
    * Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
    * Backtesting on historical data to assess real-world performance.
* **Visualization:** 
    * Visualize stock price predictions and compare them with actual prices.
    * Plot loss and accuracy during training.

## Technologies:

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch

## Functioning:

1. **Data Collection:** Obtain historical stock price data.
2. **Data Preparation:** Clean, preprocess, and engineer features.
3. **Model Building:** Create and configure the LSTM model architecture.
4. **Model Training:** Train the model using the prepared data.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
6. **Prediction and Visualization:** Generate predictions and visualize results.
